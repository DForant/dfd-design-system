Context: I am the Lead Architect for the DFD Design System. I have uploaded four distinct color palettes: Warm & Cozy, Fun & Vibrant, Cool & Industrial, and Soft & Elegant. These represent "Tier 2: Interim/Themes" in my 3-Tier Variable System.

Sheets column structure: Each sheet represents a single color palette consiting of 5 colors each with its own 5 step chromatic scale. Columns A-C have single data values that represent the general palette information. Columns D & E have the name and description for each base color in the palette. and the remaining columns represent the information specific to that color step. 

Objective: Audit these sources for naming consistency and architectural alignment. Please provide the following:

Naming Convention Check: Identify any inconsistencies in how colors are named across the four sheets. (e.g., Is one using "Blue-500" while another uses "Sky-Medium"?). Recommend a unified naming structure that fits the color/hue/step format.

Step Alignment: Compare the "Steps" (e.g., 100, 200, 300 or 10, 20, 30). Ensure that "Step 500" in Cool & Industrial has a similar perceived lightness/utility as "Step 500" in Fun & Vibrant.

Semantic Readiness: Based on the current sheets, identify which colors are the most likely candidates for the following Tier 3 Semantic tokens:

action/primary/bg

surface/page/base

text/secondary/muted

Missing Values: Note if any palette is missing a critical utility color (like a neutral "Background" or a high-contrast "Text" color) that the others possess.

Output Format: Present the findings in a Markdown table for easy review.
